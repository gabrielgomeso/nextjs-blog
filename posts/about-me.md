Hi! My name is Gabriel and I'm the owner of this blog :) <br> 
I've created it to learn a bit more about NextJS and at the same time have a register about the things I'm studying. <br>
At the second semester of 2020 I've decided that I would change my career, so I returned to study web development. So far (October, same year), I learned Javascript basics, CSS, ReactJS, NodeJS and a bit of TypeScript. <br>
Now, I'm trying to find a job. <br>
**Good luck for me!**
